# Data Structures and Sample Problems

Welcome to our repository where we dive into the fascinating world of data structures, exploring their implementations through a series of carefully selected sample problems. This repository is structured to provide a hands-on approach to learning data structures, with each folder dedicated to a specific data structure and its application.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each marked as `HWx`, where `x` ranges from 1 to 9. Inside each folder, you will find the implementation of a different data structure along with a PDF file that describes a specific problem for which this data structure is used as a solution.

### Folder Structure

- **HW1**: Turtle library in python to draw based on code reuse
- **HW2**: String encoding
- **HW3**: Recursion 
- **HW4**: Dataclasses in Python
- **HW5**: Merge Sort
- **HW6**: Stacks and Queues
- **HW7**: Hashing
- **HW8**: Trees
- **HW9**: Graph

### Inside Each Folder

- **Code**: Implementation files for the data structure.
- **Problem Description**: A PDF file containing the problem statement, its background, and why the particular data structure is an apt choice for the problem.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore**: Browse through the folders to find a data structure or problem that interests you.
2. **Read**: Open the PDF file inside the folder to understand the problem statement.
3. **Code**: Look at the implementation to see how the data structure is applied to solve the problem.
4. **Experiment**: Modify the code, run it, and experiment with your own solutions or improvements.
